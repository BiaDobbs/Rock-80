People are moving Moving to the scene Riding on a limousine
When you born
You have to pay the act You're hanged a name on & a number on your chess
People are standing Standing at the door
Thay know what they are looking for
Three five two s This you mustn't forget
To play the rules
Any place you are
Thinkin' of the good times that we had
I never thought a woman
could be so bad
I didn't realize what
love could be
Can't just help from thinking
you're my destiny
Drinkin' of the good
champagne & wine
I really love you right there. by the fire side
Round & round my brain
I'm shaken up
I'm still hunged up on you
what can I do?
For I don't know
If you're playing the game
If you're gambling again.
If you're staying in the rain
I don't know
For I don't know
If you're raising your hand.
If you're claping your hands
If you're missing me'oung (y)
I don't know
Looking for the show
People are standing Standing at the window Waiting for the sun to shine
People are dancing Dancing in the street Waiting for the music stops
For I don't know
If you're taking the train
If you're getting the plane
If you're staying in the rain I don't know
I went to see the gypsy
To have my fortune read
She said: you baby's gonna leave you.
Her bags are packed up under your bed
You got brain washed
Your life is out programmed Don't be a fool
Or else you'll be damned
& when you die
Still have to pay the tax & fill the form Just before you left
Paper bureaucracy Rubish society
I got shit for you teacher
I just had enough of your taught
For shit in you teacher
That's the only thing that you've got
I'm tired of your lessons
I can't stand anymore of your talk
Empty words from your head
That's the only thing that you've got
For I don't know
If you're saying good bye
If you're leaving me crying
If you wanna be tied
I don't know
Go round & round
Just take your body far away from the ground Go round & round
Just take yourself far high above the clouds
Above the clouds for I don't know...
I was caught by the cops
In the middle of the city
They said: stay over there.
Their guns were "packed up" over my head
Fly
Gonna fly today
Leavin' yesterday Gonna fly away
Cry
You're gonna cry today Remembering yesterday Come & fly away
You think you're the greatest
You think of yourself at the top But I'm gonna kick you down For you are the biggest nut
Out of time
Out of reach
Does anybody know you
when you're down & out?
I wanna run away
I gotta do it today
Can't you see it's okay?
Cause I wanna start something new
Nothing, that's all I got
Life it became a plot
I think that should be stopped
Cause I wanna start something new
Gonna move
Gonna fight
Gonna work new jobs
seven days a week
Gotta give back
I wear a black leather coat & ragged blue jeans
Ride a chopper motor-bike Now you know what I seem.
My eyes are closed
I'm tired
But no one seems to notice
I'm feeling so alone.
And no one seems to care
I only have her to share
Wherever's a fight
So there I am
To punch & kick & give it a damn
This life
Life or death?
How can we know?
Of course we breath?
But is this real?
Or only a show?
For I'm a rock n' roll man
Yes I am, a rock n' roll man
I wanna find a place
Where life can be fine
Sun is beginning to shine
Cause I wanna start something new.
I'm rolling down the road
For a place of my own.
I'm running all the time
Testing all that I find
Gotta come back
Gotta go right now &
bring my money home to you
But cry now baby cry
For I don't want your lovin' no more
Cry now baby cry
For I don't want your hurtin' no more
I'm looking for an answer
To all my questions
I've been asking for a long time
Only hoping to see a sign Why are we unhappy?
Why are we alone
in the middle of the crowd.
I got a nice, beauty, girl
She loves me so She follows me after Wherever I go
If I wanna make love
She squeezes me so We have big fun
& there we go
