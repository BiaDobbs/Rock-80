Left my money downtown in the bank.
And left to Lisbon after,
Kept enough just to fill up the tank,
Some change to pay for a laughter.
A lot of miles, a fuckin' trip...
The work is my big end!
Ain't got time to spend with a shit!
But I do wanna know your friend.
Where you're going Tonite?
Where you're going Tonite?
Where you're going Tonite?
Take me with ya,
Take me to hell!
Sorry 'Bout this, I put my head to loose,
You know! it's stronger than I'.
This's my break, ain't got time to choose...
Even I don't know why!?
A lot of work, a pretty smile
Is what I need right now.
I do wanna be with you for a while,
It's up to you where to go.

There's Polution all over the world
There's Polution on through the air
I'm sure there's P. all into your mind too.
There's P. between me and you
There's P. in our relationships
There's P. when I kiss your lips
Wherever you work, wherever you're sleeping
There's P. wherever, whatever you're doing!!
Civilization is our ending
Civilization is our ending
Civilization is our ending
It's just a way of doing
Polution into your ears
Polution into your head
To get reed of Polution
Start to open your head
Can no more control your nerves
Can't stand garbage smelling bad
Cut the wire of the phone
Shot your neighbours dead.
CIVILIZATION IS OUR ENDING

I dive myself into the forest
I know can be my very last day,
Can't even count on the moonlight...
The stars, so far, can't see me!
Turn my eyes up to the leaves
And feel someone is staring at me...
Why should I be scary?
For the witches above my head
They like me...
Were dancing up dressed up,
The sillouettes round & round,
Same colour of the sky around:
Dark-black, dark-smell... Darkest sound.
Living in the lap of the witches
Among those sparkles and glims,
There's no spotlights or laser beams
Can be so nice, it ain't no price.
This is Life!!
Still I am into the forest.
Haven't found my very last day.
The moonlight - today
Calls me, want's me, calls me here....

It was in a pretty nice day
Or was it a lazy day?
Won't find out and I won't even try
Was one more another day.
She was a Virgin!
She was a Virgin!
I've already met some women
Who couldn't speak or spoke to much
Some of them were frozen ice cream
And some others you couldn't touch.
She was a Virgin!
She was a Virgin!
For the first time in my life
Found the strangest of the world
- Never thought it could be true-
Was a really Virgin girl!!!!
I never thought, it's unbelievable
It was a twelve year Virgin girl!!!

Right across the road
There's a woman looking at me....
Well she's some kind of a funky lady:
She's Crissy.
In the middle of the road,
She did cross my path
Shaking head, driving me mad
And swinging her arse.
Then together we spent the night....
Both together we felt alright...
Both together we spent the night....
Then together we felt alright...
Listen to the music
Playing in your brains - is it love?
Let's do it again.
Crissy came to me
And kissed my face twice.
Well, she really knew the way
Of breaking the ice.
Right around the fire
Layin' on the sand,
Waiting for the night to come
with the first Jazz Band.
Then together we spent the night...
Some days later on,
Just before a gig,
She asked to see me, thought I pretended
To seem big
She said I felt like a star
And hardly knew my stand.
I'm afraid she didn't even try
to understand.

A sonnet bearing the imprimatur of the inquisitor-general
And other people of distinction and decency (1907?)
I had a revelation not from high,
But from below, when thy skirt awhile lifted
Betrayed such promise that I am not gifted
With words that may that view well signify.
And even if my verse that thing would try,
Hard were it, if that work came to be sifted,
To find a word that rube would not have shifted
There from the cold hand of morality.
To gaze is naught; mere sight no mind hath wrecked.
But oh! sweet lady, beyond what is seen
What things may guess or hint at disrespect?!!.
Sacred is not the beauty of a Queen...
| From thine ankle did as much suspect
As you from this may suspect what I mean.
